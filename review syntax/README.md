# Go Syntax Review
Here, I spent a little bit of my time reviewing all main keywords of Golang. If you are already family c/c++ it will provide you enough information to get down to work!<br>
Note: although most of it is like what we see in c++, try to google below concepts if you are not familiar with them.
    
    1 - Slice?
    2 - What is make() in golang?
    3 - Concurrency (what is go, select, chan keywords in golang?)

To make it simple: try to understand how to allocate memory and how to create goroutine (a lightweight thread in golang), combine these two with what you know from java or c/c++ and done here!
